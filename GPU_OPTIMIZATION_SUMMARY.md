# Create model with GPU optimizations
model = ContinuousIntegrationModel(
    num_classes=1000,
    enable_mixed_precision=True,
    memory_efficient=True
)

# Model automatically detects optimal device (MPS/CUDA/CPU)
device = model.device
```

### Training with GPU Optimizations
```bash
python3 train_imagenet_mwnn.py \
    --model continuous_integration \
    --device mps \
    --enable-mixed-precision \
    --enable-gradient-checkpointing
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
python3 test_clean_gpu.py  # Clean performance test
python3 test_simple_model.py  # Simple functionality test
```

## Stability Notes

### torch.compile Status
- **Disabled** due to tensor stride issues on Apple Silicon MPS
- Can be **re-enabled** when PyTorch MPS compilation becomes more stable
- Works well on **NVIDIA CUDA** systems

### Memory Efficiency
- **Memory-efficient operations** can be toggled via `memory_efficient` parameter
- **Gradient checkpointing** available for memory-constrained training
- **Automatic memory management** for both MPS and CUDA

## Future Enhancements

1. **Re-enable torch.compile** when MPS backend stabilizes
2. **Add more aggressive memory optimizations** for larger models
3. **Implement model parallelism** for multi-GPU setups
4. **Add quantization support** for inference optimization
5. **Optimize data loading** pipeline for better GPU utilization
