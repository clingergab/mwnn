# 🚀 MWNN Colab Quick Start (Google Drive)

**Get up and running with MWNN on Google Colab in 5 minutes using Google Drive!**

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Upload to Drive (1 minute)
```bash
# If you have the package
1. Download mwnn_colab_package.tar.gz
2. Upload to Google Drive
3. Right-click → Extract archive
```

### 2. Open in Colab (1 minute)  
```bash
1. Go to colab.research.google.com
2. File → Open notebook → Google Drive
3. Navigate to your extracted folder
4. Open MWNN_Colab_Training.ipynb
```

### 3. Set GPU Runtime (30 seconds)
```bash
Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU → Save
```

### 4. Update Project Path (30 seconds)
In the second code cell, change:
```python
PROJECT_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/mwnn-project"  # 👈 Update this
```

### 5. Run Everything (2 minutes setup)
```bash
1. Run cells 1-3 (Drive mount, navigation, data download)
2. Let ImageNet download to your Drive (runs in background)
3. Run remaining cells for training!
```

## 🎯 What You Get

- 🔄 **Resume Anytime**: Continue training after disconnects  
- 📱 **Access Anywhere**: View results from any device
- 🤝 **Easy Sharing**: Share Drive folder with collaborators

## 📊 Expected Timeline

| Task | Time | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| Setup & Mount | 2 min | Drive connected, project loaded |
| MNIST Test | 3 min | Baseline MWNN performance verified |
| ImageNet Download | 10-30 min | Dataset in your Drive (background) |
| Ablation Study | 15 min | Architecture analysis complete |
| Batch Optimization | 10 min | GPU-specific batch sizes found |
| Deep Training | 30-120 min | Full ImageNet-scale models trained |

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Project directory not found"
**Solution**: Update `PROJECT_PATH` to match your actual Drive folder path

### Issue: "GPU memory error"  
**Solution**: Run batch size optimization first, or use `COMPLEXITY = 'medium'`

### Issue: "ImageNet download slow"
**Solution**: Normal! Large dataset. Use CIFAR-100 for testing while it downloads

### Issue: "Runtime disconnected"
**Solution**: Just restart! All your data is in Drive. Re-run first few cells and continue

## 🎯 Quick Validation

After setup, verify everything works:

```python
# Run this in a new cell to verify setup
import os
print(f"✅ Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")  
print(f"✅ PROJECT_PATH: {PROJECT_PATH}")
print(f"✅ Checkpoints: {os.path.exists('checkpoints')}")
print(f"✅ Source code: {os.path.exists('src')}")
print(f"✅ Training scripts: {os.path.exists('train_deep_colab.py')}")
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Current directory: /content/drive/MyDrive/your-folder
✅ PROJECT_PATH: /content/drive/MyDrive/your-folder  
✅ Checkpoints: True
✅ Source code: True
✅ Training scripts: True
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once everything is working:

1. **Start Small**: Run MNIST validation (fast, confirms everything works)
2. **Scale Up**: Run CIFAR-100 experiments (ImageNet complexity, faster training)  
3. **Go Deep**: Train deep models with auto-optimization
4. **Full Scale**: Train on actual ImageNet data (requires patience!)

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Colab Pro**: Worth it for longer runtimes and better GPUs
- **Monitor Storage**: ImageNet uses ~40GB in your Drive
- **Save Often**: Results auto-save, but you can manually save checkpoints
- **Share Wisely**: Drive folders can be shared for collaboration
- **Mobile Monitor**: Check training progress from your phone via Drive
